# WLS Site Starter (Next.js + Tailwind)

## Quick Start
1. `npm install`
2. `npm run dev` (local dev)
3. Deploy by connecting this repo to Vercel.

## Notes
- Replace `/public/hero-placeholder.jpg` with your own.
- For fastest lead capture, paste your **AWeber embed form** into `app/contact/page.tsx` (there is a comment where to insert it).
- To keep Bluehost email working, only change A/CNAME web DNS when adding your domain to Vercel.
